# CS351/IN321: AI-assisted Software Development

## Course Description

This course introduces how modern AI tools and techniques can support the software development lifecycle. Students will learn practical workflows for using AI to assist with requirements understanding, code generation, debugging, testing, refactoring, and documentation, while maintaining code quality and reliability. The course also covers responsible and ethical use of AI (e.g., security, privacy, bias, and intellectual property) through hands-on labs and project-based practice.
