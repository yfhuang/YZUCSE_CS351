# Lecture 2: Software Development Life Cycles

## Overview

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that guides the creation of software from initial conception through deployment and maintenance. It provides a framework for planning, designing, implementing, testing, and deploying software systems.

## Key Phases

### 1. Planning and Requirements
- Define project scope and objectives
- Gather business requirements
- Identify stakeholders and resources
- Perform feasibility analysis

### 2. Analysis
- Document detailed requirements
- Create specification documents
- Define success criteria
- Plan resource allocation

### 3. Design
- Architect system structure
- Create design specifications
- Plan database schemas
- Define user interfaces and workflows

### 4. Implementation (Development)
- Write code according to design specifications
- Follow coding standards and best practices
- Perform code reviews
- Document the codebase

### 5. Testing
- Conduct unit testing
- Perform integration testing
- Execute system testing
- Validate against requirements

### 6. Deployment
- Prepare production environment
- Release to users
- Provide user training
- Monitor initial performance

### 7. Maintenance and Support
- Fix bugs and issues
- Implement enhancements
- Provide user support
- Monitor system performance

## Popular SDLC Models

- **Waterfall**: Sequential phases with minimal overlap
- **Agile**: Iterative development with continuous feedback
- **DevOps**: Emphasis on integration and continuous deployment
- **Spiral**: Risk-driven approach combining iterative and waterfall elements

## Best Practices

- Clear communication among team members
- Comprehensive documentation
- Regular testing throughout the cycle
- Stakeholder involvement and feedback
- Version control and change management
