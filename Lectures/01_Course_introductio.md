# Lecture 1: Course Introduction

This lecture introduces the course structure, prerequisites, teaching methodology, and grading criteria. Students will learn about the importance of computational and strategic thinking in problem-solving, and gain an overview of course objectives focused on mastering data structures, algorithms, and advanced programming techniques.


## Prerequisites
- Programming experience in C, C++
- Computational thinking
    - Computational thinking – the ability to reformulate and solve problems in ways that can be undertaken by computers – has been heralded as a foundational capability for the 21st Century. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-022-10921-z)
- Strategic thinking
    - Strategic thinking is a mental or thinking process applied by individuals and within organizations in the context of achieving a goal or set of goals. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_thinking)

## Teaching Method
- Lecture (English)
- On-site mini project practices
- Assignment report review

## Grading
