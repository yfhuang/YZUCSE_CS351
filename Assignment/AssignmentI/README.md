## Tasks

### 1) Create / verify your GitHub account
- Sign in to GitHub: https://github.com/
- Update your profile (name, avatar, short bio as needed)

---

### 2) Create new repositories (2 repos)
Create **two** new repositories on GitHub:

1. **Personal website repository** (for GitHub Pages)
    - Suggested name: `<username>.github.io` (recommended for a user site)
    - Initialize with:
      - `README.md`
      - (Optional) `.gitignore`

2. **Course repository**: `11402_CS351`
    - Use this repo to store CS351 assignment files and documentation
    - Initialize with:
      - `README.md`
      - (Optional) `.gitignore`

---

### 3) Write your README in Markdown
In your **course repository**, write a `README.md` that includes:
- A short introduction of yourself
- What this repository is used for
- A link to your GitHub Pages site (after you publish it)
- Notes about how you organize files/folders

---

### 4) Publish a GitHub Pages site
**Note:** This task is for your **personal website repository** (recommended: `<username>.github.io`) only.

Enable GitHub Pages for your repository and publish a simple site.

References:  
- About GitHub Pages: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages  
- Custom domain (optional): https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site

After publishing, record your Pages URL, for example:
- `https://<username>.github.io/`
- or `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

---

### 5) (Optional) Build documentation with Sphinx
If you choose to use Sphinx, add a `docs/` folder (or similar) and record how to build it (commands) in your repository.

---

### 6) Submit
Prepare the following links for submission:
- Your GitHub profile URL: `https://github.com/<username>`
- Your course repository URL: `https://github.com/<username>/11402_CS351`
- Your GitHub Pages URL: `https://<username>.github.io/...`

Submit using the course form (if provided by your instructor):
